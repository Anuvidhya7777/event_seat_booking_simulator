# Event Seat Booking Simulation Web App

    This project is a simple and professional **event seat booking simulation web application** designed for organizers who do not have an existing seat booking system for their event halls.

    The application allows organizers to dynamically create a seating layout based on the number of rows and columns, and enables users to book seats through an intuitive web interface.

## Problem Statement

    Many small to medium event halls do not have a proper digital seat booking system unless they already maintain a full-fledged web application. This makes seat management difficult and error-prone during events.

    This project aims to provide a **lightweight, web-based seat booking solution** that can be used independently without complex setup.
